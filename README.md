## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, the emergence of edge computing presents a transformative approach to data processing and model deployment. Edge ML leverages the computational power of local devices, enabling real-time, efficient, and autonomous decision-making without the latency and bandwidth constraints associated with cloud computing. This paradigm shift is particularly impactful in the domain of physical training and exercise, where immediate feedback and personalized training regimens can significantly enhance performance and user engagement.
This project explores the application of edge ML in developing a system that provides real-time feedback and guidance during training exercises. By processing data directly on edge devices such as smartphones and wearable technology, the system aims to deliver personalized exercise routines and corrective feedback instantly, thereby optimizing the training effectiveness and improving user adherence to physical fitness goals. 
 

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the experience and effectiveness of personal training through the application of edge machine learning technologies. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:
Develop an Edge-Optimized ML Model: Design and train a machine learning model that is optimized for performance on edge devices with limited computational capabilities. The model should be capable of processing real-time data from users during exercises to provide immediate feedback.
Implement Real-Time Data Processing: Utilize sensors and other data-capturing technologies to gather exercise-related data from users. This data will be processed directly on the userâ€™s device, minimizing latency and ensuring that feedback is both timely and relevant.
